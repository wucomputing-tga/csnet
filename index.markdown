# CSNeT

CSNeT (Computer Science NeTwork) is an after school programme run at the University of Waikato's Tauranga campus by [Au Reikura - School of Computing & Mathematical Sciences](https://www.waikato.ac.nz/about/faculties-schools/cms/) for secondary level students who are interested in technology. The programme typically takes place over the course of Term 2 each year. Classes are run every Monday from 3:30-5:00pm. 
  
**Registrations for Term 2 2024 are now closed**

Please see the following document for the 2024 schedule: [Schedule_2024.pdf](https://wucomputing-tga.github.io/levels/schedule.pdf)

# What is CSNeT?

CSNeT is tailored towards students of differing levels and ability. With 4 levels available students can select the exercises best suited to their ability with advanced exercises available for accelerated students. We also come together for group sessions on robotics and information on careers in the technology sector with invited industry experts. 

## Levels

### Level 1: Byte Sized Basics üë©‚Äçüíª

In level 1 students are introduced to taster sessions that cover the fundamentals of computer science and key programming concepts. Students will learn how to program graphical user interfaces, event-driven programming and more!

### Level 2: Bits and Bots üöô

In level 2 students will get hands on experience with programming embedded systems using our bbc micro:bit equipment. Students will learn about the Python programming language as well as concepts related to data structures and quality assurance. 

### Level 3: Beyond Beta üßê

In level 3 students will learn about software engineering and follow the software development lifecycle. They will learn about requirements elicitation, software design and testing including heuristic evaluation techniques. 

### Level 4: Bricks, Barks & Binary ü§ñ

In level 4 students will engage with our robotics equipment, specifically Norbert the Robot Dog & our Lego Mario equipment! We use this to teach the fundamentals of robotics but also to explore sensors and Internet of Things concepts.
